# Strapion

**Strapion** is an alternative Strapi admin for content creators. It is customizable, translatable and mobile-friendly.

## Features

- 🌐 Multilingual (i18next)
- 🎨 Customizable theme (antd and Tailwind CSS)
- 🧩 Multiple injection zones
- 🧱 Swappable components
- 📜 Custom pages
- 🔌 Plugins
- 💯 100% TypeScript

## Quick Start

Create a new Strapion project with the Create Strapion App tool:

```shell
npx create-strapion-app@latest cms
```

Next, go into the newly created `cms` directory and install the dependencies. When that's done, run

```shell
npm run dev
```

Your Strapion project will run on http://localhost:1338

## Motivation

Strapi is the most popular JavaScript headless CMS available but its admin is notoriously uncustomizable. Strapion
provides an alternative admin that is built with React and easy to customize and extend. It uses popular frameworks and
libraries that should be familiar to many developers. The goal of Strapion is not to be a full replacement of Strapi's
own admin. Creating content types, setting up login providers and other plugin management tasks are things that content
creators never have to deal with. These features only confuse most admin users. Instead, Strapion wants to be the "third wheel"
in the Jamstack relationship: the frontend (e.g. Next.js), the API (Strapi) and the content management UI (Strapion).

## Limitations

Strapion is **not a drop-in** replacement of the Strapi admin, and for two reasons. The first reason is that Strapion targets
_content creators_ and does not support features such as content creation and plugin settings. But another reason is that
Strapion takes a different approach on how to **configure** the admin. Instead of putting all configuration in the database -
making it hard to migrate between environments, do translations, etc. - Strapion takes most configuration from a single
configuration object.
