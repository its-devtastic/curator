# Configuration

Strapion is _very_ customizable. Most of the configuration is done by modifying the `strapion.config.ts` file. If you've
used the Create Strapion App tool it will have created it for you. To make managing the config a bit easier it also extracted
some files to a `config` folder. This is just for convenience, feel free to arrange it as you see fit.
