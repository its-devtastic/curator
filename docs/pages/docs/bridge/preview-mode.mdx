# Preview mode

By default Strapi only returns published content. For content editors, however, it's important to be able to preview
drafts before they go live. Luckily this is quite easy with Curator Bridge!

### isAdminUser

Bridge provides a simple utility function to check if a user is logged in with Studio and is an **active user** on Strapi.

```ts
const showDrafts: boolean = await isAdminUser(headers: Headers, {
  strapiUrl?: string,
} = {});
```

Alternatively, you can provide the URL to your Strapi instance by setting an environment variable.
Either `STRAPI_URL` or `CURATOR_STRAPI_URL` can be used.

#### Example

```ts filename="page.tsx"
const showDrafts = await isAdminUser(headers(), {
  strapiUrl: "https://api.example.com",
});
const response = await fetch(
  `/api/pages?publicationState=${showDrafts ? "preview" : "live"}`
);
```
