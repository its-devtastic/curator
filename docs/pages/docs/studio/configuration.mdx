# Configuration

Curator is _very_ customizable. Most of the configuration is done by modifying the `curator.config.ts` file. If you've
used the Create Curator App tool it will have created it for you. To make managing the config a bit easier it also extracted
some files to a `config` folder. This is just for convenience, feel free to arrange it as you see fit.
