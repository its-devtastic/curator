**Curator** is an alternative admin for [Strapi](https://www.strapi.io).

## Features

### Studio

Modern, customizable admin built with React, Ant Design and Tailwind.

### Bridge

Fully integrated Next.js website with preview mode and integrated editing.

### Strapi Plugin

Super-charge your Strapi instance with our Strapi plugin.

## Quick Start

Create a new Curator project with the Create Curator App tool:

```shell
npx create-curator-app@latest
```

## Motivation

Strapi is a popular headless CMS, but it's missing some basic features and its admin is notoriously uncustomizable.
Curator offers a Strapi plugin that adds those features, and an alternative admin app that is easier to customize.
